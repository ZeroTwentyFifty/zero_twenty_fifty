"""
TODO: This module needs some serious attention and basically needs to be reworked in
order to be understandable and testable, it was taken from somewhere else during the
PoC process in order to move forward, and ideally it would have been edited into
something cleaner before graduating to Alpha, but it will take too much time, so
it will be worked on in Alpha and will be redone and tested before Beta release.
The main issue is that testing programmatically leads to RuntimeErrors, and it
is (to me), currently incomprehensible without spending a significant amount of 
time to understand some of the more arcane parts of it.

    Starlette middleware to intercept API responses and add pagination-related headers.

        2. Calculates the URL for the 'next' page of results (if applicable).
        3. Adds a 'Link' header to the response, guiding clients on how to fetch the next data set.

    Testing Notes:
        * Consider extracting link-generation logic into a separate, testable helper function.
        * Use mocking to replace 'count_product_footprints' in endpoint tests. This lets you focus on
          pagination behavior without requiring a live database.
