 Yes, using Docker for local testing with PostgreSQL can be a great idea, especially as your application grows. It can help you maintain consistency between your local and production environments.

The Docker image you mentioned, `ghcr.io/railwayapp-templates/timescale-postgis-ssl:pg13-ts2.12`, is a good option. It includes PostgreSQL 13, TimescaleDB 2.12, and PostGIS.

Here's a basic guide on how to set it up:

1. Install Docker on your local machine if you haven't already.

2. Create a new directory for your Docker setup and navigate into it.

3. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in this directory. This file will contain the instructions for building your Docker image.

4. Open the `Dockerfile` and add the following content:

```
FROM ghcr.io/railwayapp-templates/timescale-postgis-ssl:pg13-ts2.12

# Set environment variables
ENV POSTGRES_USER=postgres
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
ENV POSTGRES_DB=postgres

# Expose the PostgreSQL port
EXPOSE 5432
```

5. Save and close the `Dockerfile`.

6. Now, you can build your Docker image by running the following command in the terminal:

```
docker build -t my-postgres .
```

7. Once the image is built, you can run a container from it with the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name my-postgres-container my-postgres
```

8. This will start a new container based on your Docker image and map the container's port 5432 to your local machine's port 5432.

9. You can now connect to your PostgreSQL database using the connection string `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`.

10. To stop the container, use the following command:

```
docker stop my-postgres-container
```

Remember to replace the `localhost` in the connection string with the appropriate IP address if you're running Docker in a virtual machine or a remote server.

This is a basic setup and you may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements. You can also use Docker Compose to manage your Docker containers if you have multiple services that need to be run together.
